## Animations & UX

- **Welcome Animation (Login Only)**
  - Shown immediately after a successful login, once per browser session.
  - Controlled via `sessionStorage.welcome_after_login_shown`.

- **Love (Heart) Animation**
  - Clicking the Love button on any place card shows a 1s full-screen heart pulse.
  - The card is added to "What I've Seen" (`localStorage.seen-places`).

- **Card Created Animation**
  - After adding a new place, a 1s success pulse appears.
  - The place is saved to `localStorage.user-places`.

## Core Features & How To Use

- **Add Place**
  - Open the Add Place dialog from the profile menu.
  - Fill in: `Name`, `Description`, `Area (required)`, and set `Location` by search, map click, or "Use my location".
  - Optional single photo upload with preview and remove.
  - The dialog is scrollable when content exceeds the viewport.

- **Location Search & Map**
  - Suggestions show under the Location search (not under Name) to avoid overlap.
  - Press Enter or click Go to jump the mini-map marker to the first result.
  - Drag the marker or click the map to fine tune coordinates.

- **Love a Place**
  - Click the heart on any card to save its ID to `seen-places`.
  - The heart turns red for loved items.
  - A quick animation confirms the action.

- **What I've Seen**
  - Page shows only the loved places.
  - You can "Unlove" (remove) any place; it updates immediately.

- **Map Page**
  - Opens centered to a small bounding box if `?lat&lon` are present.
  - Supports searching via the header search box to move the view.
  - All contributed places (from `user-places`) are visible.

## Data Storage (Client-side)

- `localStorage.user-places`: Array of contributed places.
- `localStorage.seen-places`: Array of loved place IDs.
- `sessionStorage.welcome_after_login_shown`: Prevents repeat welcome in same session.

## Troubleshooting

- **Animations not visible**
  - Ensure no custom extensions are blocking overlays.
  - For Love animation, itâ€™s rendered above the content; it disappears after 1s.

- **Location search not moving the map**
  - Press Enter in the Location box or click Go to resolve to coordinates.

- **What I've Seen is empty**
  - Love a card first; it stores the place ID in `seen-places`.

## Scripts

```bash
npm run dev       # start development server (default port 9002)
npm run build     # production build
npm run start     # run production server
```

## Notes

- The app uses client-side storage to prototype contributions and favorites. If you clear browser storage, lists will reset.
- You can fine-tune the animation duration by changing the `setTimeout(..., 1000)` calls in relevant components.
